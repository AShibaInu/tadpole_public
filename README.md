# A Deep Learning Apprach to TADPOLE
Danlu Huang, Evan Yu, Zhilu Zhang

This repository contains every function and model used for the TADPOLE challenge. It does not contain the TADPOLE data since it was removed as requested in the project instruction. As a result, you cannot run the notebooks. Nevertheless, it details everything we have implemented.
